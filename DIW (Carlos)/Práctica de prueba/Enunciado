# Advanced Flexbox Exercise: Social Media Dashboard Layout

Your task is to create a responsive social media dashboard layout using CSS flexbox. The layout should adapt to different screen sizes and include the following components:

1. A header with a logo and navigation menu
2. A main content area with:

    A user profile section
    A feed of posts
    A sidebar with trending topics and suggested follows

3. A footer with multiple columns

## Requirements:

1. Use flexbox for all layouts (avoid using grid or float).
2. The layout should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
3. On desktop:

    The header should have the logo on the left and navigation menu on the right.
    The main content should be a row with the profile on the left, feed in the center, and sidebar on the right.
    The footer should have 4 columns of equal width.

4. On mobile (screen width less than 768px):

    The header should stack the logo above the navigation menu.
    The main content should be a single column with the order: profile, feed, sidebar.
    The footer should have 2 columns.

5. Implement the following specific flexbox challenges:

    Use `flex-grow` to make the feed take up any available extra space in the main content area.
    Use `order` to change the layout of elements on mobile.
    Implement a flexible grid of cards for the feed posts (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile).
    Use `align-self` to vertically center the logo in the header while keeping other elements at the top.

6. Add some interactivity:

    When hovering over nav items, use CSS to change colors
    Implement a "sticky" header that remains at the top of the page when scrolling.

Bonus:

    Implement a dark mode using CSS custom properties.
    Create a "load more" button at the bottom of the feed that's always centered.

Remember to use semantic HTML5 tags where appropriate and comment your CSS to explain your flexbox choices.
